  HeroTwo is a 2D multiplayer game built using the Phaser Javascript library. The game objective is similar to catch the flag but still a work in progress. The web application includes a chat box for online messaging implemented with Socket.io. I plan to use this technology to incorporate online multiplayer capability as well. In the meantime, you can run around the tall grass with a friend on one local machine.

To Get Started:
  1. Use the link above to demo the game!
  2. Clone this repo, npm install, npm run start, and you're good to go!
